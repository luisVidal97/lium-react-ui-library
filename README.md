## Developed with üõ†Ô∏è

* [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library) - Libary to create more React libraries
* [JavaScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Pogramming language
* [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) - Used library to created styles dynamically, without using any file of css.

Inside the root directory, src/components path, you can find a folder with each component. Each one has  its own main file, which one is the name of the component. Then, you can find a file for styles and other file for validations. The last one, it validates all props and transform the data in variables that the component can use.
Besides, each component has its own test file in the sr/test folder.
